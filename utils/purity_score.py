Computation of purity score with sklearn.

    """Purity score

    To compute purity, each cluster is assigned to the class which is most frequent
    in the cluster [1], and then the accuracy of this assignment is measured by counting
    the number of correctly assigned documents and dividing by the number of documents.
    We suppose here that the ground truth labels are integers, the same with the predicted clusters i.e
    the clusters index.

    Args:
        y_true(np.ndarray): n*1 matrix Ground truth labels
        y_pred(np.ndarray): n*1 matrix Predicted clusters

    Returns:
        float: Purity score
